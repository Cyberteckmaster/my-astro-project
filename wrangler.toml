Here’s a **ready-to-commit `wrangler.toml`** tailored for your Astro project **cyberteckmaster** with placeholders you must replace with your actual Cloudflare info:

```toml
name = "cyberteckmaster"
type = "javascript"
account_id = "YOUR_CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID"    # Replace with your Cloudflare Account ID
workers_dev = false
compatibility_date = "2025-05-28"

# Routes to bind your Worker to your domain and zone
routes = [
  { pattern = "cyberteckmaster.com/*", zone_id = "YOUR_ZONE_ID" }  # Replace with your Zone ID
]

[site]
bucket = "./build"    # Astro build output directory

[build]
command = "npm run build"

[vars]               # Add any environment variables here (non-secret)
SOME_API_URL = "https://api.example.com"
ANALYTICS_KEY = "your-analytics-key"

[kv_namespaces]      # Example KV binding — optional, remove if unused
  [[kv_namespaces]]
  binding = "MY_KV"                  # Binding name in your Worker code (env.MY_KV)
  id = "YOUR_KV_NAMESPACE_ID"       # Replace with your KV Namespace ID
```

### What to do next:

* Replace all the placeholder values (`YOUR_CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID`, `YOUR_ZONE_ID`, `YOUR_KV_NAMESPACE_ID`) with your real Cloudflare account and resource IDs.
* Commit this file to the root of your Git repo (`git add wrangler.toml && git commit -m "Add Cloudflare Wrangler config"`)
* Push to your production branch (likely `main`) — Cloudflare will pick up changes and run your build & deploy.
* Use `wrangler secret put SECRET_NAME` to add any secrets you need (not stored in this file).
